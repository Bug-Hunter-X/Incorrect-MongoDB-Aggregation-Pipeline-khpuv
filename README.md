# Incorrect MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. The error arises from an incorrectly structured `$group` stage, causing incorrect grouping and potentially unexpected results.

## Bug Description
The aggregation pipeline aims to group documents based on a specific field, count occurrences, sort them and limit the results. However, due to an error in the pipeline structure, the grouping is incorrect, leading to wrong counts or missing groups. 

## Solution
The solution provided corrects the aggregation pipeline by ensuring the `$group` stage is correctly structured, accurately grouping documents and producing the desired counts.
